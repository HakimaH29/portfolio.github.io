# Final Project

This project is a portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website showcases various portfolio items and includes sections for the portfolio, about, and contact information. I utilized Font Awesome for signs and symbols, and in particular, BOOTstrap was used for its modal properties to be applied on the images, which allows the user to hover and zoom in.
